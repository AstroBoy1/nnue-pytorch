# Setup

#### Install PyTorch

[PyTorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install python-chess==0.31.4 pytorch-lightning==1.9.5 torch matplotlib tensorboard
```

#### Install CuPy
First check what version of cuda is being used by pytorch.
```
import torch
torch.version.cuda
```
Then install CuPy with the matching CUDA version.
```
pip install cupy-cudaXXX
```
where XXX corresponds to the first 3 digits of the CUDA version. For example `cupy-cuda112` for CUDA 11.2.

CuPy might use the PyTorch's private installation of CUDA, but it is better to install the matching version of CUDA separately. [CUDA Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

#### Build the fast DataLoader
This requires a C++17 compiler and cmake.

Windows:
```
compile_data_loader.bat
```

Linux/Mac:
```
sh compile_data_loader.bat
```

# Network training and management

Hard way: [wiki](https://github.com/official-stockfish/nnue-pytorch/wiki/Basic-training-procedure-(train.py))

Easier way: [wiki](https://github.com/official-stockfish/nnue-pytorch/wiki/Basic-training-procedure-(easy_train.py))

# Logging

TODO: Move to wiki. Add setup for easy_train.py

```
tensorboard --logdir=logs
```
Then, go to http://localhost:6006/

# Automatically run matches to determine the best net generated by a (running) training

TODO: Move to wiki

```
python run_games.py --concurrency 16 --stockfish_exe ./stockfish.master --c_chess_exe ./c-chess-cli --ordo_exe ./ordo --book_file_name ./noob_3moves.epd run96
```

Automatically converts all `.ckpt` found under `run96` to `.nnue` and runs games to find the best net. Games are played using `c-chess-cli` and nets are ranked using `ordo`.
This script runs in a loop, and will monitor the directory for new checkpoints. Can be run in parallel with the training, if idle cores are available.
